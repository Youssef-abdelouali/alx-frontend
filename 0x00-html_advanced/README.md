# Techium HTML Basics Project

Welcome to the **Techium HTML Basics** project! This project is part of the Web Stack specialization, where you'll learn the essential foundations of web development using **HTML**. By the end of this project, you’ll be able to structure a web page using semantic HTML tags.

## Project Overview
In this project, you will:
- Create the skeleton of an HTML5 page.
- Learn to use semantic HTML tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, and more to structure your content.
- Practice using lists, tables, images, videos, and embedding external content into a webpage.
- Focus on writing clean and compliant HTML code (validated using W3C).

**Note:** No CSS or styling is used in this project. The focus is entirely on HTML structure.
